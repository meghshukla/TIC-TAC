# TIC-TAC
Code repository for "TIC-TAC: How To Learn And Evaluate Your Covariance". We derive the TIC: Taylor Induced Covariance and show that incorporating the gradient and curvature results in better covariance predictions. We also propose TAC: Task Agnostic Correlations, a new metric to quantitatively evaluate the covariance.
